# flood_bot

Command line tool in Ruby to send a given number of messages to a recipient.

To run this tool, simply download the ZIP file, decompress it, and navigate to the folder into which you have decompressed it. From there, run the terminal command:

```
ruby floodbot.rb
```

You will then just have to follow a set of prompts to use the program. Once it is up and flooding, you should see a stream of `true` going down your terminal window. Every time that a message is successfully sent, “true” is printed to the terminal, so a long string of `true` means that everything is working perfectly.
